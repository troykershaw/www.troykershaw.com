The inaugural [Sydney F# User Group](http://www.meetup.com/fsharpsydney) meeting was held on 1 July. We had a great turn out and great times were had by all. There were two talks, one by me, the other by the amazing [Jorge Fioranelli](https://twitter.com/jorgefioranelli) who runs the user group with me.

The videos are available on [our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/fsharpsydney). We'll be making every talk available on there so make sure you subscribe or you risk not living a productive, meaningful life.

My talk was a light introduction to F#, function purity and immutability, particularly the dangers that Fry and Leela from Futurama encountered when they were flippant with mutation.

I had a lot of fun presenting it, I hope you enjoy watching it.
