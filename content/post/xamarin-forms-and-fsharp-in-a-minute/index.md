F# works quite well with Xamarin.Forms. At September's [Sydney F# User Group](http://www.meetup.com/fsharpsydney) meeting I gave a talk on how to get started by building a Twitter app that randomly selects a tweet to give a prize to.

I plan to write a detailed _How To_, but for now, enjoy the video!
